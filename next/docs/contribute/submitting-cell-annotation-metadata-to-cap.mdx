# Submitting cell annotation metadata to the Cell Annotation Platform (CAP)

## Submission process

Data contributors will be notified once their datasets have been validated and upload to CAP has been initiated. Instructions will be provided on how to create a profile on CAP and enter cell annotation metadata - this is easily done using the CAP user interface.

1. In order to accept the invite and edit the draft workspace, data curators will need to create a profile on CAP with details such as name, contact email and academic institution.

2. Data contributors will receive an email from CAP inviting them to a draft workspace on the CAP website containing information already provided to the HCA wranglers during the submission of data matrices as well as the Tier 1 validated datasets.

3. Data contributors will need to complete the cell annotation metadata fields for all cell labels using the CAP platformâ€™s user interface. This can be done by an individual or by a group working within the private workspace.

        a. Collaborators can be invited to contribute to the workspace by workspace owners and admins by clicking on Collaborators. 

4. Once the required fields have been completed, the draft publication will be submitted to review by CAP data curators and then published on the CAP website for others to view. 

        a. Should new annotation sets be added or edited, a new version of the annotations can be published.

Note: As a tool that is open and available for use by the broader scientific community, CAP can also ingest datasets that are not being used for atlas assembly. To do this, contributors should visit the [CAP website](https://celltype.info/) and sign up or log in. Detailed instructions on how to submit, annotate, and then publish annotations are available [here](https://celltype.info/docs).
