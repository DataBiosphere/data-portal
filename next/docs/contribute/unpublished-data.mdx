# Contributing Unpublished Data

**HCA welcomes the contribution of unpublished data to atlases**

HCA welcomes the contribution of unpublished data to atlases and has put in place mechanisms to protect the data prior to the publication of atlases. Importantly, contributors of unpublished data are encouraged to make their data publicly available immediately via the HCA Data Repository, in accordance with the HCA Data Release Policy.

If the data contributors are unable or decline to do so, they must, at minimum, agree to make their data publicly available via the HCA Data Repository (for raw sequence data and detailed Tier 2 metadata) and Chan Zuckerberg CELLxGENE (for gene expression matrices, Tier 1 metadata, and broad demographic metadata) as soon as the Atlas that incorporates it is published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.  

**Embargoing unpublished data**

If you are contributing unpublished data, you may request that your data be “embargoed” in a private HCA data repository until the organ/tissue/system atlas you have contributed to is published. At that point, your data will be made available publicly via the HCA Data Explorer and linked to the corresponding Atlas page on the HCA Data Portal. Data contributors will be notified before their data is made public. Access to embargoed data will be restricted to HCA Data Wranglers, the corresponding Atlas integration team, and anyone else specified by the data contributor.
