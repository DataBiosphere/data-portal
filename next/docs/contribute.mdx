# Overview

The following instructions are for scientists wanting to contribute datasets to the Human Cell Atlas (HCA). For data to be included in atlases, data contributors must provide the following data and metadata. The data and metadata are stored in three platforms to ensure adequate protection is provided to sensitive information (e.g. FASTQ and Tier 2 metadata) and non-personal data is more openly available.

The [CellxGene Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections) platform stores matrices (in AnnData format) and Tier 1 metadata which are the core building blocks of atlases. Tier 1 metadata fields are typically ‘technical’ in nature (e.g. whether there was cell enrichment or depletion). For support creating an AnnData file, refer to this [tutorial](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 

The [HCA Data Repository](https://explore.data.humancellatlas.org/projects) stores FASTQ files and the Tier 2 metadata which may contain personal information. To provide sufficient protection to this information, the HCA Data Repository operates a managed access service through the DUOS platform. Access to these datasets and metadata requires the submission of a Data Access Request which is reviewed by HCA’s global Data Access Committee. 

The [Cell Annotation Platform](https://celltype.info/) stores matrices and cell annotation metadata in a specially designed portal with features that allow members of the HCA community to jointly annotate data.
