The human pancreas is a physiologically unique organ that is both an exocrine and endocrine gland. It is involved in the secretion of several hormones, including insulin for blood sugar regulation and enzymes for the digestive system. Dysregulation of the physiological functions of the pancreas can result in diseases such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or diabetes mellitus. Unfortunately, the pancreasâ€™ high autolytic activity makes it challenging to study.

The Pancreas Biological Network will integrate molecular transcriptome data from millions of single cells with epigenomics profiles, tissue spatial transcriptomics and proteomics from all regions of the pancreas (head, body, tail and islets) to identify cell types and/or states and their phenotypes in healthy adults and in disease. Further, it will complement the Developmental Cell Atlas by characterizing the molecular and cellular landscape of the developing human pancreas in the prenatal and postnatal period.
