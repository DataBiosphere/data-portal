The integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) represents the first large-scale,
integrated single-cell reference atlas of the human lung. It consists of over
2 million cells from the respiratory tract of 486 individuals, and includes 49
different datasets. It is split into the HLCA core, and the extended or full
HLCA. The HLCA core includes data of healthy lung tissue from 107 individuals,
and includes manual cell type annotations based on consensus across 6
independent experts, as well as demographic, biological and technical
metadata. The datasets in the HLCA core were integrated using scANVI. The HLCA
core can be used as a reference to map new datasets onto using scArches. The
full HLCA includes 35 further datasets that include donors with various lung
diseases. These datasets were mapped onto the core with scArches, and include
disease annotations as well as cell type annotations transferred from the HLCA
core onto the mapped datasets. Note that while the the HLCA includes an
integrated, batch-correctd low-dimensional embedding, the gene counts
themselves were not batch-corrected. Both the HLCA core and the full HLCA can
be explored below. Detailed information about all metadata in the objects, as
well as further HLCA-related information, can be found on the HLCA landing
page: <Link label="https://github.com/LungCellAtlas/HLCA" url="https://github.com/LungCellAtlas/HLCA" />. Raw counts
are available in the downloaded .h5ad at adata.raw.X, in the downloaded
.rds at seurat_object@assays$RNA@counts, and via CELLxGENE Census.
