The cerebral cortex is essential for many of our behaviors and higher-order cognitive functions and exhibits striking cytoarchitectural, cellular, molecular, and functional variation. The Human Cortical Cell Atlas v1.0 is based on a highly detailed analysis of 8 cortical regions spanning the range of functional, structural, and topographic variation in the human neocortex. These include regions that include primary (motor, M1; somatosensory, S1; auditory, A1; visual, V1) and association areas (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DFC, specifically Brodmann area 9 in the superior frontal gyrus; anterior cingulate cortex, ACC; middle temporal gyrus, MTG; angular gyrus, AnG), span the rostral to caudal extent of the cortical sheet, and represent major variations in cortical cytoarchitecture. Single nucleus RNA-seq (both SMART-seqv.4 and 10X Chromium v.3) was performed on over one million isolated nuclei.

The Human Cortical Cell Atlas v1.0 is presented for visualization and data mining through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiativeâ€™s CELLxGENE application, with the following biologically meaningful partitions:

- Supercluster-specific groupings
- Cortical region-specific groupings
