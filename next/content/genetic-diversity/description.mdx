The composition and molecular properties of human cells within complex tissues are highly variable, influenced by genetics, age, sex, and environment. These factors also influence risk of contracting and suffering harm from diseases and individual response to treatments. However, most human genetic studies are focused on individuals with European ancestry.

Given the high levels of genetic, phenotypic and environmental diversity among human populations, the Genetic Diversity Network aims to characterize the impact of genes and environment on molecular traits in cells from ethnically diverse individuals across the globe. By characterizing differences within and across human populations, this resource will help us understand variation in disease risk and treatment response, and thus lay a foundation for more effective medical and public health interventions.
