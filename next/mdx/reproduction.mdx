The reproductive system is the system of organs involved in producing offspring. Alterations of the physiological functions of the reproductive system can result in diseases such as infertility or cancer.

The Reproductive Network of the Human Cell Atlas aims to generate a detailed, dynamic map of the cells forming reproductive tissues across the lifespan. To do so, we are combining single-cell genomics with spatial transcriptomics and proteomics tools to disentangle tissue organisation and cell signalling within the tissue compartments. This detailed study of the reproductive tissues will be critical for understanding many understudied reproductive disorders, as well as cancer. Furthermore, the single-cell multi-omics roadmap for reproductive tissues will be used as a blueprint for the improvement and development of new in vitro models to recapitulate cell behaviour in physiological and pathological conditions.
