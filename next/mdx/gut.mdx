The intestine is one of the most complex organs in the human body and serves a wide range of functions, including the digestion and absorption of nutrients and a major site of immune interactions. Different anatomical sections of the gut play specific roles in the digestive process, which are performed by different tissue compositions or cell types in each section that communicate with each other in myriad ways. Interactions with trillions of nearby microbes add further complexity.

The Gut Biological Network of the Human Cell Atlas aims to generate a detailed map of the cells forming the intestinal tube, thereby providing critical information that will allow us to further unravel the complex networks that operate in health. Importantly, understanding the healthy gut provides the starting point for interrogating related diseases such as bowel cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases, which affect an increasing number of patients.

An initial roadmap for the Gut Cell Atlas was released in 2021 with funding from the Helmsley Charitable Trust. The roadmap was subsequently updated and expanded by the HCA Gut Biological Network and will be released in Spring 2023.
