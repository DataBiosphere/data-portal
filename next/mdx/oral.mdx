Oral and craniofacial tissues are incredibly diverse, including tongue, teeth, gums and glands. Each of these is supported by epithelia, cartilage, bone, ligaments, muscles, adipose tissue, blood and lymphatic vessels, and nerves; and all of these tissues are harmoniously integrated into the vital functions of communication, feeding, breathing, defense, sensing, and early digestion. These tissues are intimately interconnected with the nervous, immune and endocrine systems, as well as with microbes. Oral and craniofacial tissues are affected in many disorders and diseases that can decrease quality of life and cause deleterious psychosocial issues, emphasizing the need for effective, precise, and aesthetic strategies for the regeneration of craniofacial tissues.

The HCA Oral & Craniofacial Biological Network aims to create comprehensive and integrated cell atlases to understand the common and unique cell types that support these niches in health and uncover which cell types and networks are affected in disease. This level of cell annotation and integration will be critical for understanding oral and craniofacial diseases across the lifespan. In tandem, due to the growing body of literature displaying interconnected roles for oral and systemic health, findings from this network will be critical to future meta-analyses with other tissue and organ atlases for precision diagnostics and treatments.
