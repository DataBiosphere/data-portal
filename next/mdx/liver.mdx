The human liver is a central coordinator of metabolism, an immune system hub, and the primary site of drug processing in the body. Diseases of the liver are a major and increasing burden worldwide, affecting over a billion people, due to conditions including obesity, chronic infection, autoimmune disease, drug toxicity and alcohol use disorder. The current treatments for many chronic liver diseases are of limited effect, and once chronic injury progresses to end stage liver disease, transplantation is the only effective therapy.

The Liver Biological Network seeks to spatially, structurally, and genomically map the normal liver at single cell resolution, from early development to childhood and adulthood across diverse ethnicities, races, and sexes. Ultimately, comprehensive single cell maps of the healthy and diseased liver will provide a foundation to develop new therapies for liver disease and the basis for evaluation of the liverâ€™s response to these treatments.
