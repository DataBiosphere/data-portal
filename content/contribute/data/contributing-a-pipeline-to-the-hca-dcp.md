# Contributing a Pipeline to the HCA DCP

Data modalities to be analyzed in the HCA DCP Green Box are chosen by the Data Coordination Platform Governance Group (DCPGG). Pipelines for these modalities are included for use in the HCA DCP after they have been evaluated and approved by the HCA Analysis Working Group. The evaluation includes portability testing of the candidate pipeline using the [Portability Service](/pipelines/hca-pipelines/data-processing-pipelines/pipeline-portability).
 
The service sends the candidate pipeline definition and the test input data to one or multiple external execution infrastructures, which run the pipeline and send the results back for comparison to the expected results using the evaluation tool provided by the pipeline developer.

If you are interested in submitting a pipeline for evaluation, please contact us at data-help@humancellatlas.org.
