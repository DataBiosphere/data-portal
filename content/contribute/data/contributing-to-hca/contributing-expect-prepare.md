# Data Submission Process

Once you are ready to submit your data, you will be supported by the Human Cell Atlas data wranglers. We currently use spreadsheets to collect metadata and a command-line tool to transfer the data files to our cloud infrastructure. 

![contribute](../../_images/contribute.png)

In order to process your cellular resolution data, we will request the following information:

- Unprocessed data files
- Information on samples
- Information on experiment and protocols
- Summary of project and team information
- Confirmation that data is consented for open access
