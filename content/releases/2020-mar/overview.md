## 2020 March HCA DCP Release 

The DCP March 2020 release includes datasets from all human DCP projects that have been processed using DCP standardized pipelines (Optimus or Smart-seq2). Overall, projects were stratified into individual datasets by organ, developmental stage, and sequencing technology, and were further processed using [Cumulus](INSERT LINK), a tool for cell clustering, differential expression analyses, and visualization. Cell type annotations were taken from publications or project contributor feedback, were harmonized, and then added to analyzed files. You can read more about these processes from the [Methods page](INSERT LINK) or you can take a [tutorial on how to replicate these analyses](INSERT LINK).
