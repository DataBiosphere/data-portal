# 2020 March Data Release 


## Release Datasets


The <link-to-browser relativelink="/releases/2020-mar">March 2020 Data Release</link-to-browser>
 includes datasets from all human DCP projects that have been processed using the DCP's standardized pipelines (<link-to-browser relativelink="/pipelines/optimus-workflow">Optimus</link-to-browser> or <link-to-browser relativelink="pipelines/smart-seq2-workflow">Smart-seq2</link-to-browser>). 

Projects were stratified into individual datasets by organ, developmental stage, and sequencing technology, and were further processed using [Cumulus](https://cumulus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cumulus.html#), a tool for cell clustering, differential expression analyses, and visualization.
 
Cell type annotations were taken from publications or project contributor feedback, were harmonized, and then added to analyzed files.

To learn more about these processes and get started working with the release, please review the [Methods](methods.md) documentation, take a [tutorial on how to replicate these analyses](replicating-the-hca-dcp-release-analysis.md) or view tips for [working with release files](working-with-release-files.md).
