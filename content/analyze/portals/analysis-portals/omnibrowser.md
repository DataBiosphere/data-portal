[OmniBrowser™](https://omnibrowser.abiosciences.com/) is a web portal for multi-omics single-cell data exploration, supported by a spectrum of commonly used tools for data visualization and analysis. The OmniBrowser™ toolset is designed with special attention to support biologists with limited programming and analytical bandwidth or depth.

The underlying database of OmniBrowser™ is currently the largest curated scRNA-seq dataset collection in the world, with >3060 datasets from >1560 publications in publication consistency. To dig into such datasets, OmniBrowser™ provides a series of web-based tools, including gene expression query, dimensional reduction visualization, differential expression analysis, cross-dataset analysis, similar gene search, GO analysis and customized annotation.

Datasets are constantly updated on OmniBrowser™ in order to support the constantly growing demands from a wide range of customers. As datasets and analytical functions continue to expand on the OmniBrowser™ platform, Abiosciences will develop and distribute more collection of tools that will make the analyses of big data more efficient and effective in order to advance the biomedical R&D.
