[Polly](https://www.elucidata.io/platform/features) is a biomedical data platform for life sciences R&D, primarily delivering bulk RNA-seq and single-cell data, along with 24 other data types. It delivers **155 TB of FAIR and ML-ready biomedical data from ~30 different (primarily public) sources** to customers.

Polly takes care of data ingestion, transformation, and storage. Therefore, researchers can focus on insight derivation via **data analysis, visualization instead of data wrangling and engineering**. It is easy to incorporate Polly into your existing data infrastructure because we offer integrations to your existing data storage units as well as **analysis/visualization, and computational tools**.

Polly creates a unique, centralized ecosystem that enables a diverse team of biologists, bioinformaticians, and scientific leaders to share and collaborate on workspaces, data, and insights. It has enabled the detection of multiple validated drug targets across immunology, oncology, and metabolic disorders using ML-ready and a scalable data infrastructure for downstream analysis provided by Polly.
