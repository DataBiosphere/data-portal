[UCSC Cell Browser](http://cells.ucsc.edu/) is a software tool for single cell RNA expression, a 2D viewer that shows cells as a dimensionality reduction plot with the expression data overlaid. The viewer allows a visual comparison of large single-cell datasets in 2D, overlaying metadata, marker gene levels and cell clustering information. This is useful when comparing single cell layout (dimensionality reduction) methods and batch correction methods.
