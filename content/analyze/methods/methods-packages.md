#  Methods Packages

Methods packages listed below are tools for performing analyses involving computational biology approaches for analyzing single cell data. Method software is pre-installed in container images. Registry methods can be called programmatically for easy integration into portals. These methods provide domain-specific ways to analyze biological data produced by Human Cell Atlas.

These solutions are built by third parties, and fostered by the HCA DCP.

>Are you developing a package that can consume HCA data? Please [submit it](/contribute/analysis-tools-registry) for inclusion in the registry.
