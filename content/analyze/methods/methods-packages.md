#  Methods Packages

Methods packages listed below are tools for performing analyses involving computational biology approaches for analyzing single-cell data. Method software is pre-installed in container images. Registry methods can be called programmatically for easy integration into portals. These methods provide domain-specific ways to analyze biological data produced by Human Cell Atlas.

These solutions are built by third parties. This information is provided as a service to the community and does not constitute an endorsement by the HCA.
