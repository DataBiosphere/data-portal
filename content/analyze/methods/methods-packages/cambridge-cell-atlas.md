The [Cambridge Portal of the Human Cell Atlas](https://www.cambridgecellatlas.org/) is a joint initiative between groups at EMBL-EBI and the Wellcome Sanger Institute. The project analyses, visualises and provides tools for exploration of single cell RNA-Seq data generated by the international Human Cell Atlas initiative, as well as other projects on human tissue. The portal is managed by the Gene Expression Team at EMBL-EBI in collaboration with the Wellcome Sanger Institute Cellular Genetics Programme.
