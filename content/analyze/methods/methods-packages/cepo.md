Defining the identity of a cell is fundamental to understand the heterogeneity of cells to various environmental signals and perturbations. We present Cepo, a new method to explore cell identities from single-cell RNA-sequencing data using differential stability as a new metric to define cell identity genes. Cepo computes cell-type specific gene statistics pertaining to differential stable gene expression.
