# About the Data Coordination Platform

The Human Cell Atlas Data Coordination Platform (HCA DCP) is an open source, cloud-based platform developed to organize, standardize, and make accessible the data that constitute the Human Cell Atlas.

This platform has been constructed by a consortium of scientists, engineers, and designers from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the Broad Institute (Broad), and the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). 

The HCA DCP wouldn't be possible without community involvement. The easiest way to get involved is by helping us with feedback and testing. Learn more on the [Contact](/contact) page.
  
We also encourage you to contribute your data or analysis portals and methods. Learn more on the [Contribute](/contribute) page.
