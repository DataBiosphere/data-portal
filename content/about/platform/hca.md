# About the Human Cell Atlas

The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) is a collaborative community of international scientists. Our mission is to create comprehensive reference maps of all the cells in the human body as a basis for both understanding human health and diagnosing, monitoring, and treating disease.

The HCA registry has more than one thousand member scientists from hundreds of institutions around the world. The project is steered and governed by an Organizing Committee, co-chaired by Aviv Regev and Sarah Teichmann.
