# DCP Content Style Guide

## Goal of this guide 

Our goal in building the Human Cell Atlas *Data Portal* is to make data and tools open and easily accessible to scientists around the world.  To accomplish this, we not only need a robust, easy-to-use technology platform, but also simple and clear content to help scientists and developers accomplish their goals. The content on the *Data Portal* will come from many writers and in many forms, but we want to create a sense of consistency in our tone and terminology to help users understand and navigate our services.

This document lays out some rules and best practices for writing this content.  We will update this guide as our rules evolve.  All guidelines presented here should be reviewed and approved by the UX, content, and PM teams, and all content published on the data portal or in communications from the DCP should align with these rules.

## Voice and Tone

The voice of the *Data Portal* is:
* Human
* Straightforward but not simplistic 
* Friendly but not overly casual
* Direct but not bossy
* Precise but not bogged down in details
* Helpful but not condescending
* Professional but not stodgy
* Polite but not formal

Just like a person, the *Data Portal* should have a cohesive voice, but can have a varied tone depending on context.  
As users navigate our site, or interact with us via Zendesk or email, may have different needs, and the tone of the content should adapt to fit those needs. The tone of API documentation might be different than the tone of the help page, for example. 

## General Rules
### Language

The language of the Data Portal is **US English**, consistent with the language of the HCA website.

### Acronyms and Abbreviations

* Before using an acronym or abbreviation, first ask - does this term need to be shortened? Is there a simpler word that could be used?
* On each page or document, introduce acronyms before using. For first use, spell out the terms and then give the acronym in parentheses. All other mentions on the page or document can use the acronym. For example:

  1st use - "Human Cell Atlas (HCA)"
  
  2nd use - "HCA"

* Commonly used acronyms can be used without introduction (e.g., RNA, API).  
* Do not use casual abbreviations like “info.”

### Slang, Jargon, and technical terms

* Avoid jargon if a simpler, plain English word exists. Keep in mind that DCP users will come from various backgrounds, with different knowledge sets. Even words that are fairly common within the scientific or developer communities may be unfamiliar to some users here, and should only be used if needed.
* Avoid slang or overly casual terms. The *Data Portal* should feel professional.
* Where a technical term is needed, make sure to introduce it or give it context first. Before using the technical term, do a quick check to make sure it’s commonly used and understood (i.e., Google the term to see whether and how it’s used elsewhere).  Avoid using any term that is ambiguous. 

### Passive vs. Active Voice

Use active voice whenever possible.    
  * Active voice - Access the data manifest by clicking *Download*.  
  * Passive voice - A data manifest can be accessed by clicking *Download*. 

Exception: There are a few cases where the action is emphasized over the subject, especially when the actor in the sentence is unknown/ambiguous or the action was not intentional. Use your best judgement in these cases.

For example:
   * "The download was paused." vs. "You paused the download."
   * "This data set has been flagged for removal." vs. "We flagged the dataset for removal."

### Politeness
* Our voice should always be polite but not overly formal.
* Reserve "please" or "thank you" for cases where we are asking the user to do a task that is particularly difficult or doesn't align with their primary goal for being on the site. For example:
  * YES: "Click here to download a manifest.'
  * NO: "Please click here to download a manifest."
  
  * YES: "Thank you for completing our survey."
  * NO: "Thank you for visiting our site."
  
### Contractions
Commonly used contractions like “don’t”, “it’s”, “isn’t”, “doesn’t”, “we’d”, etc. can be used in order to make our content a bit more conversational and human. However, for documentation we recommend NOT contracting the 2 words to help emphasize the point; for example, ‘does not’ (or ‘does NOT’) is likely to be more clear to a reader than ‘doesn’t’, especially if the person is not a native English speaker.  Use your judgement on this issue -- you don’t want to sound excessively formal but you do want your documentation to be clear to any reader.

### Text Formatting
* Use italics and capitalization to refer to site elements within the *Data Portal*, and specific datasets. For example:
    * Visit *Explore* to view available datasets.
    * The *Census of Immune Cells* dataset contains about 530,000 cells.
    
* Capitalize, but DON'T italicize our services, like Ingest Service, Data Store, etc.

* Capitalize the words in titles, for example: Use Title Caps, not Use title caps
    
* Spell out numbers when they begin a sentence or for the numbers zero through five, unless referring to a measurement or when comparing to other numbers.  Otherwise, use the numeral. For example: 
  * There are four main sections in the *Data Portal*.
  * These 2 visualization portalks are better suited to this use case than the other 10 on the site.
  * This project has 24 specimens.
  * Download up to 1.5 Tb of data at a time.

* When referring to a file type, use all uppercase (e.g., PDF, TXT, or "Download the TXT file on this page."). When referring to a specific file, use all lowercase (e.g., brain.pdf).

* Each sentence, even a sentence fragment, should start with a capital letter and end with a period.

* Keep paragraph size to 3-4 sentences OR LESS. Add subheadings to break up longer paragraphs, for ease of reading on the web.

### Graphics and Color
* Make sure that the colors in your graphics are color-blind friendly.  There are many helpful articles online about choosing the best colors; for example, [How to Optimize Charts For Color Blind Readers Using Color Blind Friendly Palettes](https://venngage.com/blog/color-blind-friendly-palette/)
 

### How to refer to users and team members
* While our team’s name is officially, the “Data Coordination Platform team” or DCP team, this overly technical to surface to Data Portal users.  Instead, refer to the DCP team as “the HCA Portal team”.
  * Use “we”, “us”, “our” when writing about our team to give the writing a more human feel.
  
* Write to users in the second person, using “you”, “yours”.
  * How to access your data.
  * AVOID using third person to describe user actions, such as "A researcher can.." or "One may...", as it's overly stiff for our voice.

### Word list 
[Word list decision doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tEjnSrhOs_FoiSO9hDOKS9z8Qbk4kV_f9HoM-i5WCkQ/edit)

Words:
* **Data Portal** - the name of our site, and the generic name for user interactions with the site.
   * For example: Contribute your data to the HCA *Data Portal*.
   * Always caplitalized
* **Data Coordination Platform/DCP** - the name of our platform, used only in more technical documents.
  * For example: Learn more about how you can reuse portions of our Data Coordination Platform.
  * Always capitalized
  * ALways introduce before using the acronym 
* **Dataset** - not data set
* **Homepage** - not Home page
* **Data Processing Pipelines** should replace "Secondary Analysis" and "Secondary Analysis Service"  
* **Analysis Applications** should replace "Tertiary Analysis"
