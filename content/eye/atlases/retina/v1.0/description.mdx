### Highlights

1. Two parallel references were derived from single cell and single nuclei RNA-seq, respectively.
1. Over 120 cell types in the human retina are identified, nearly doubling the number reported in previous studies.
1. Integrative atlas with RNA and ATAC-seq, generating comprehensive gene regulatory landscape at single-cell resolution for the human retina.

### Overview

As the light-sensing part of the visual system, the human retina is composed of five classes of neurons, including photoreceptors, horizontal cells, amacrine, bipolar, and retinal ganglion cells.
Each class of neuron can be further classified into subclasses, with the abundance varying three orders of magnitude.
Therefore, to capture all cell types in the retina and generate a complete single-cell reference atlas by combining previously published and newly generated datasets, a single-cell atlas of the human retina that is composed of 3.4 million single nuclei or cells from 122 donors has been collected.
As a result, over 120 distinct cell types are identified based on the transcriptomics profile, with the rarest cell type accounting for about 0.01% of the cell population. In addition, open chromatin profiling has been collected for over 470K nuclei via single nuclei ATAC-seq, allowing systematic characterization of cis-regulatory elements for individual cell types. Both sn/scRNA-seq and snATAC-seq datasets are made accessible through interactive browsers. This represents the most comprehensive reference cell atlas of the human retina to date, laying the foundation for further research in understanding retina biology and diseases.
