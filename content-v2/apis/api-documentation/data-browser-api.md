# Data Browser API

The HCA DCP Data Browser API specifies a REST web service for querying metadata associated with both experimental and analysis data stored in the HCA Data Store.
 
 In order to deliver response times that make it suitable for interactive use cases, the set of metadata properties that it exposes for sorting, filtering, and aggregation is limited.
  
Data Browser API provides a uniform view of the metadata over a range of diverse schemas, effectively shielding clients from changes in the schema as they occur over time. 

The API specificatoin is located at: https://service.dev.singlecell.gi.ucsc.edu/
