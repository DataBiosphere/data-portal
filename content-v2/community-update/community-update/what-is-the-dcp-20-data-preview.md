# What is the DCP 2.0 Data Preview?

For the Data Coordination Platform (DCP) 2.0, we are adding contributor-genereated matrices, reprocessing DCP projects, and adding 16 new projects (read the full details of the changes in the DCP [Updates](/dcp-updates)).  

The DCP 2.0 Data Preview is a separate data view enabling you to explore and access the new contributor-generated matrices as well as the new and reprocessed DCP data as soon as they become available! 

## How are the DCP 1.0 View and DCP 2.0 Data Preview different?

**DCP 1.0 View**:

The [DCP 1.0 View](https://data.humancellatlas.org/explore/projects?filter=%5B%7B%22facetName%22:%22genusSpecies%22,%22terms%22:%5B%22Homo%20sapiens%22%5D%7D%5D&catalog=dcp1) lists all the original DCP (DCP 1.0) projects. 
From this view, you can:
- Access raw data for DCP 1.0 projects
- Access DCP 1.0 processed data generated with standardized pipelines (BAMs, etc.)
- Download DCP 1.0 project matrices (in CSV, MTX, and Loom formats)

**DCP 2.0 Data Preview**:

The [DCP 2.0 Data Preview](https://data.humancellatlas.org/explore/projects?filter=%5B%7B%22facetName%22:%22genusSpecies%22,%22terms%22:%5B%22Homo%20sapiens%22%5D%7D%5D&catalog=dcp2) lists all DCP projects, including the 16 new DCP 2.0 projects.
From this view, you can:
- Download the new contributor-generated matrices for each project* 
- Access the raw data for all DCP projects; for DCP 1.0 projects, this raw data is the same as that in the DCP 1.0 view 
- Access data generated with updated DCP standardized pipelines**
- Download the newly processed DCP-generated matrices (Loom format only)**

\*Contributor-generated matrices are provided by the project contributors 

** Standardized data and matrices will be added to the DCP 2.0 Data Preview incrementally as they become available

**Switching between DCP 1.0 Data and DCP 2.0 Data Preview**

Use the banner at the top of the Data Portal to switch between the two views:

![Data Preview](../../guides/_images/data_preview_2.png "Data Preview")


As we continue to (re)process old and new DCP projects, we will incrementally add the newly processed data and DCP-generated matrices to the DCP 2.0 Data Preview. 

Once processing is complete, we will retire the DCP 1.0 View.
