## What to prepare

### Breadth of the data and metadata

We aim to collect sufficient information about any experiment to enable your data to be used in building the Human Cell Atlas and for other scientists to be able to understand your dataset and reproduce the outcomes without needing to contact you to ask for more details. 

We are working with scientists like you to define our metadata standards and what are the minimum requirements are to describe experiments in the Human Cell Atlas. You can see our standards in the metadata dictionary. Please contact us if you feel there is something missing or there is required information that you will not be able to supply.

## What to submit

As the data contributor, you may need to consult with your colleagues, e.g. collaborators or the core facility personnel performing sample preparation or sequencing for you, to gather all detailed information for a successful submission. We will need you to provide:

### Metadata

- Project description to give context to the data set
- Collaborator and funder information (who else has worked on this project, please include the principal investigator on the project)
- Sample descriptions (as much detail as possible about the individual, organ specimen, cell suspension, or tissue sections that your experiments used). This will include details such as sex of the individual, the organ sampled, how the cells were dissociated, or how the tissue section was fixed)
- Experimental details (such as how the sequencing library was produced or how the images were captured and what probes were used in the experiment)
- Protocols for all experiments (sample collection, library preparation, and sequencing). We accept links to your protocols in protocols.io.

### Unprocessed data files
- Compressed raw sequence files (e.g. fastq.gz)
- Imaging files (e.g. tiff stacks)

### Supplementary data files 

If you have generated other files associated with your experiment - such as images of the sampled organ or FACS plots for your cell population - you will be able to upload these as supplementary files and associate them with your project. 

Please note we will not host your results from data processing pipelines, such as alignment or quantification files. The platform produces these using standard pipelines providing uniform results across the the datasets we host.

You can provide us a link to a public location for files of this type if you have deposited in another resource like GEO, ArrayExpress, or Zenodo.
