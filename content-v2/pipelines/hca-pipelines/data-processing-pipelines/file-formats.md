# File Formats of the Data Processing Pipelines Service

## Matrix Download File Format

Matrices are provided in [Loom](http://loompy.org/) file format and be downloaded through the HCA Data Portal. From the Portal's Data Browser, you can make a multifaceted search to dynamically generate and download matrices. Alternatively, you can explore the matrices available for download on the individual project pages.

#### Working with Loom Files

Loom files can be explored using multiple Python- and R-supported downstream analysis tools, including [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/), [SCANPY](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy), and [Pegasus](https://pegasus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 


## Contributor-generated Matrix File Format
When available, contributor-generated expression matrices will be provided on project pages. These matrices will vary in file format.
