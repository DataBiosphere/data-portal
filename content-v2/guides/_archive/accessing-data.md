## Overview of Accessing Data
There are several ways of accessing data in the *Data Store*. Some methods are better suited to computational biologists while some are targeted at researchers. Both types of users need to be able to locate data of interest first. 

### How to find data
The simplest way to find data of interest is by using the Data Browser, which is accessed via the *Explore* tab in the portal. Another method is to use the HCA command line interface (CLI) to search for data. Using the browser is much more intuitive but searches via the CLI can be much more powerful. A third method of finding data is by writing Python scripts that search the data directly from a software program. 

The [Quick Start Guide](/guides/quick-start-guide) shows how to download data via either the Browser (in *Explore*) or via the CLI. It also includes some pointers to other tools that can be used once the data of interest has been identified.

The section "Using the Data Browser to Access Data" (in the Quick Start Guide) describes how to download selected subsections of data.

The [Using the CLI to Access Data](/getting-started/userguides/accessing-data/using-the-cli-to-access-data) section details how to use each of the commands available in the Data Store CLI.
