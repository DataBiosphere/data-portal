## Overview of Analysis Applications

"Analysis Applications" is a term generally referring to analysis outside of the *Data Portal*. This may refer to downloading HCA data and using it in *de facto* software tools or interacting with a portal that communicates transparently with the *Data Portal*. These solutions are not built by the HCA DCP implementation team but are solutions we foster and support.   

We are developing this space into a collection of guides describing how to use the HCA data and perform analysis, as a data scientist, using software that is compatible with the DCP system.
