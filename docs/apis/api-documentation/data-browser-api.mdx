# Data Browser API

The Azul Data Browser API specifies a REST web service for querying metadata associated with both experimental and
analysis data.

To deliver response times that make it suitable for interactive use cases, the set of metadata properties that the Data
Browser API exposes for sorting, filtering, and aggregation is limited.

Data Browser API provides a uniform view of the metadata over diverse schemas, effectively shielding clients from
changes in the schema as they occur over time.

For more information on the Data Browser API, see
the [Data Browser API Specification](https://service.azul.data.humancellatlas.org/).
