            <p>What's it all about, Alfie?</p>
            <p> Is it just for the moment we live?</p>
            <p>What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?</p>
            <p>Are we meant to take more than we give</p>
            <p>Or are we meant to be kind?</p>
            <p>And if only fools are kind, Alfie</p>
            <p>Then I guess it is wise to be cruel</p>
            <p>And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie</p>
            <p>What will you lend on an old golden rule?</p>
            <p>As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie</p>
            <p>I know there's something much more,</p>
            <p>Something even non-believers can believe in</p>
            <p>I believe in love, Alfie</p>
            <p>Without true love we just exist, Alfie</p>
            <p>Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie</p>
            <p>When you walk let your heart lead the way</p>
            <p>And you'll find love any day, Alfie</p>
            <p>Alfie</p>
